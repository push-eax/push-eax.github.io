<em class="caption">It's me, talking about myself on the Internet.</em></p>
<p>My resume is <a href="/pdfs/Kiernan_Roche_Resume.pdf">here</a>. <!--It's only a short summary of my professional history; I go into greater detail about that, and the course of my life more generally, in <a href="#autobiography">this section</a>.--></p>
<h3>Some facts about me in descending order of professionalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm an information security professional, and I hack things.<ul>
<li>Currently, I work in Amazon's physical stores group on the offensive security team. I perform penetration tests and red team assessments of the software, infrastructure, and devices that support Amazon's physical stores, including Amazon Go. These assessments involve the application of techniques used by hackers, and we use the assessment findings to reduce the risk of real attacks.</li>
<li>Prior to Amazon, I performed similar work as an independent consultant and on behalf of Synopsys and VSR for their clients.</li>
<li>I've been doing this sort of work since 2018, but my deep interest in and involvement with computers began circa 2005, and I developed an interest in security right before Kali replaced BackTrack.</li>
<li>My technical interests and expertise include:<ul>
<li>Application and network security</li>
<li>Windows and Linux OS internals</li>
<li>Malware analysis and malware C2 / botnet architecture</li>
<li>Social engineering techniques and their psychology</li>
<li>The tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of modern adversaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I deeply enjoy writing software. Sometimes I write useless or impractical software to prove a point or for its own sake, but my work usually has practical applications, at least for me. If I think it might also be useful to others, I try to release it under a permissive license, because free and open source software is important to me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I attended Framingham State University in Framingham, Massachusetts and earned my B.S. in computer science there in May 2020.</li>
<li>I like finance and <a href="/blog/categories/finance">writing about finance</a>. I think money is a tool that can be used to solve an important set of personal and societal problems if used judiciously.<ul>
<li>In college, I interned at Fidelity Investments and learned a lot about options trading and market behavior. Beating the market is effectively impossible without lots of data (and statistical models trained on that data), low-latency order execution, and high liquidity. I don't have most of these things, so I'm not an active trader.</li>
<li>I keep my books in a double-entry fashion using <a href="https://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a>. I experimented with plaintext accounting software such as <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a> for about a year and a half before returning to GnuCash. Despite no longer using them, I think plaintext accounting tools are simple, elegant, and well-suited for technically inclined people. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I ride motorcycles. I'm particularly fond of sportbikes. </li>
<li>Fitness, nutrition, and human physiology are deeply interesting to me. My exercise regimen includes running, weightlifting, and frequent hiking. I also prefer biking over driving for local transportation (I use public transit instead where available), because it's healthy, it's fun, it's cheap, and it has a negligible emissions footprint.</li>
<li>My music taste is highly varied, but I especially appreciate:<ul>
<li>Electronic music in its various forms<ul>
<li>Jungle and its derivatives<ul>
<li>Most styles of drum &amp; bass e.g. LTJ Bukem, Technical Itch, Dom and Roland, Current Value, Katharsys, DJ Hidden</li>
<li>Breakcore e.g. Enduser, bioxeed, Rotator, Sewerslvt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed Harrison's game soundtrack work, especially the Neotokyo Source mod OST</li>
<li>Qebrus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most styles of rock, metal, and derivatives thereof e.g. Deftones, Tool, Chevelle, P.O.D.</li>
<li>Death Grips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have ADHD. My brain has the capacity and tendency to absorb and analyze large quantities of information quickly, but controlling <em>what</em> it focuses on requires significant effort, which can preclude sustained focus on what I <em>should</em> be doing. This made my grades highly inconsistent during my entire academic career, but over the years I developed strategies to handle this. Like many people with ADHD, I also experience hyperfocus very regularly, which is focus bordering on obsession with a task or topic sustained for a long period to the exclusion of other things. This can be tremendously helpful for completing large and complex projects quickly or rapidly learning about a new topic, but it needs to be managed to avoid neglecting other urgent tasks, such as eating and sleeping; in the depths of hyperfocus I can lose awareness of my body's physical cues.</li>
<li>My mind is analytical and calculating, and I tend to think in terms of lists, functions, cost-benefit, etc. However, I also experience emotions <strong>intensely</strong>, which is probably why I'm drawn to art, as art is the primary medium for the communication of emotional states between humans, among other functions e.g. serving as a cultural lynchpin.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roche">This dude</a> was my grandfather. I come from a family of actors and I performed on stage frequently in high school, but I chose not to enter that profession for various reasons.</li>
</ul>
