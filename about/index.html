<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I grew up in the Greater Boston area and am a product of Massachusetts public schools. My father worked in IT, and we always had lots of commodity hardware lying around the house, which I eagerly disassembled and analyzed. This progressed to writing software and breaking into networks as a teenager (the skid years). I decided to make a legitimate career out of that, which has taken me to where I am now professionally (albeit in a nonlinear fashion - see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiernan-roche">my LinkedIn</a> for professional details about me).</p>
<p>Personality-wise, I'm a meticulous, goal-oriented, and slightly eccentric person. I'm fiercely loyal to my friends and family and strongly believe in the importance of treating all people with kindness and empathy.</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a social chameleon with my feet in many worlds at once. I enjoy the company of people from all walks of life, representing a wide range of occupations (or none at all), and I travel the country and the world to meet and spend time with them.</p>
<p>My general approach to life is to take calculated risks, figure out what doesn't work quickly, and iterate on that. More philosophically, I try to keep the scope of my ego and subjective self-hood as small as possible, so that I can grow as quickly as possible. I consider my identity to be a fungible thing; that is, if some aspect of myself is no longer serving my goals, it should be replaced with something more suitable, which is a continuous evolutionary process. This requires a constant lack of comfort: pushing the boundaries is necessarily painful, which is something I embrace in all areas of life.</p>
<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>I'm a sales engineer at <a href="https://netspi.com">NetSPI</a>, an offensive security company. I work with NetSPI's sales team to scope and price penetration tests and security products. Since I've personally performed most of our service offerings, I have unique insight and expertise that makes me a useful technical resource to our sales representatives, who do not come from a technical background.</p>
<p>Before NetSPI, I worked as an independent consultant. I'm also a former Amazonian - Amazon is a great company filled with very smart people.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kiernan-roche">my LinkedIn</a> for a complete CV.</p>
<h3>Where I live</h3>
<p>I live and work in Greater Boston, but travel frequently for work and for fun. I like this part of the US, but intend to leave soon to explore other places.</p>
<h3>Other interests</h3>
<p>Fitness is extremely important to me now, but I didn't take my fitness seriously until my early 20s when I started distance running. In my mid 20s I shifted my focus to weightlifting, but I still love to run and hike on the weekends. I try to keep my regimen varied to avoid the effects of my body getting too accustomed to particular stimuli.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A well built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it, no money can buy it. You cannot borrow it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it. You cannot hold onto it without constant work. It shows discipline, it shows self respect, it shows patience, work ethic and passion. That is why I do what I do." 
- Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been riding motorcycles since college and I will never stop until I'm physically unable to continue. I'm very fond of Japanese sportbikes, and I don't like Harleys. Fight me!</p>
<p>I love the English language and I believe speaking and writing it should elevate it beyond a simple tool for communication to the level of art. I want to learn other languages too, but haven't made much progress. Here are my approximate levels of proficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish (A2)</li>
<li>Russian (A1)</li>
<li>Mandarin (A1)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a lifelong learner and I continuously expand my knowledge through various means, including books, documentaries, and Wikipedia binges. I do this out of genuine curiosity and a desire to better understand the world.</p>
<p>I love classic science fiction. Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> series is my favorite. I also really like cyberpunk fiction, e.g. William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em> and Neal Stephenson's <em>Snow Crash</em>. Though not a book, <em>The Matrix</em> trilogy also has a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I grew up playing a lot of videogames, though I don't play much anymore. <em>Half-Life 2</em> and Valve's various projects were extremely important in shaping my taste and formed a large part of my childhood. <em>Halo</em> also deserves a mention here. I came of age at the tail end of the era where game communities ("clans") relied mostly on PHP forums and Ventrilo/TeamSpeak/Mumble for communication. At the age of 11, I was running such a clan myself. It's a time of my life I look back on very fondly.</p>
<p>My music taste is highly varied, but I especially appreciate electronic music (particularly drum and bass / jungle / breakbeat), trip hop, metal, and grunge.</p>
<p>I love to rave. I travel around the US and the world to attend music festivals with my friends, and I love to dance! Some of my most important and emotional experiences have happened at festivals and raves.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roche">This dude</a> was my grandfather. I come from a family of actors and I performed on stage frequently in high school, but I chose not to enter that profession for various reasons.</p>
