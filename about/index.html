<em class="caption">It's me, talking about myself on the Internet.</em></p>
<h3>Some facts about me in descending order of professionalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm an information security professional, and I hack things.<ul>
<li>I currently perform various security services through my company, <a href="https://www.darkhint.io/">Dark Hint Labs</a>. Please direct all business proposals and requests there.</li>
<li>I formerly worked for Amazon as a security engineer. It was a good experience and I have great respect for the engineering culture and organization there.</li>
<li>I've been working in infosec ("cybersecurity") since 2018, but my deep interest in and involvement with computers began circa 2005, and I developed an interest in security right before Kali replaced BackTrack.</li>
<li>I've started five companies and all of them have failed except Dark Hint (which isn't a startup, it's just a vehicle for my consulting work), but I learned something from each. I describe these lessons in greater detail on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiernan-roche">LinkedIn</a>.</li>
<li>My technical interests include:<ul>
<li>Application and network security</li>
<li>Windows and Linux OS internals</li>
<li>Malware analysis and malware C2 / botnet architecture</li>
<li>Social engineering techniques and their psychology</li>
<li>The tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of modern adversaries</li>
<li>Threat intelligence and the relationship between cyber threat actors and geopolitics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I attended Framingham State University in Framingham, Massachusetts and earned my B.S. in computer science there in May 2020.</li>
<li>I like finance and <a href="/blog/categories/finance">writing about finance</a>. I think money is a tool that can be used to solve an important set of personal and societal problems if used judiciously.<ul>
<li>In college, I interned at Fidelity Investments and learned a lot about options trading and market behavior. Beating the market is effectively impossible without lots of data (and statistical models trained on that data), low-latency order execution, and high liquidity. I don't have most of these things, so I'm not an active trader.</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a> for personal accounting. Initially I used <a href="https://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a> for this purpose, and even switched back to it for a time after using beancount, but found it antiquated and inflexible. I find plaintext accounting tools in general, and beancount specifically, to be simple, elegant, and well-suited for technically inclined people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fitness, nutrition, and human physiology are deeply interesting to me. My exercise regimen includes running, weightlifting, and frequent hiking. </li>
<li>I ride motorcycles. I'm particularly fond of sportbikes. I don't like cruisers.</li>
<li>I live minimally and frugally, and I have few possessions. I do not own a car, by choice.</li>
<li>My music taste is highly varied, but I especially appreciate:<ul>
<li>Electronic music in its various forms<ul>
<li>Drum and bass and its various subgenres and derivatives<ul>
<li>LTJ Bukem, Lemon D, Goldie and anything from Metalheadz generally, Dillinja</li>
<li>Hospital Records, Liquicity</li>
<li>Technical Itch, Dom and Roland, Current Value, Katharsys, DJ Hidden, anything from PRSPCT or Barcode Recordings</li>
<li>Breakcore e.g. Enduser, bioxeed, Rotator, Sewerslvt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed Harrison's game soundtrack work, especially the Neotokyo Source mod OST</li>
<li>Qebrus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most styles of rock, metal, and derivatives thereof e.g. Deftones, Tool, Chevelle, P.O.D.</li>
<li>Death Grips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have ADHD. My brain has the capacity and tendency to absorb and analyze large quantities of information quickly, but controlling <em>what</em> it focuses on requires significant effort, which can preclude sustained focus on what I <em>should</em> be doing. This made my grades highly inconsistent during my entire academic career, but over the years I developed strategies to handle this. Like many people with ADHD, I also experience hyperfocus very regularly, which is focus bordering on obsession with a task or topic sustained for a long period to the exclusion of other things. This can be tremendously helpful for completing large and complex projects quickly or rapidly learning about a new topic, but it needs to be managed to avoid neglecting other urgent tasks, such as eating and sleeping; in the depths of hyperfocus I can lose awareness of my body's physical cues.</li>
<li>My mind is analytical and calculating, and I tend to think in terms of lists, functions, cost-benefit, etc. However, I also experience emotions <strong>intensely</strong> and I have a deep appreciation for art, as art is the primary medium for the communication of emotional states between humans, among other functions e.g. cultural expression.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roche">This dude</a> was my grandfather. I come from a family of actors and I performed on stage frequently in high school, but I chose not to enter that profession for various reasons.</li>
