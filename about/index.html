<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. My dad worked in IT, so we always had computers lying around. I started taking things apart and putting them back together, which eventually progressed to a career in cybersecurity consulting. I now sell the same professional services I used to perform.</p>
<p>I'm a meticulous, goal-oriented, and slightly eccentric person. I'm driven by a desire to become the best possible version of myself, to the point of obsession, for better or worse.</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a social chameleon with my feet in many worlds at once. I enjoy the company of people from many cultures and walks of life, and I travel the country and the world to meet and spend time with them.</p>
<h3>What I do professionally</h3>
<p>I'm a sales engineer at <a href="https://netspi.com">NetSPI</a>, an offensive security company. I work with NetSPI's sales team to scope and price penetration tests and security products. My former life as a pentester gives me unique insight and expertise that makes me a useful technical resource to our sales representatives.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kiernan-roche">my LinkedIn</a> for a complete CV.</p>
<h3>Where I live</h3>
<p>I live and work in Boston, and travel frequently for work and pleasure. I like this part of the US, but intend to leave soon to explore other places.</p>
<h3>Other interests</h3>
<p>I'd describe weightlifting as my primary pursuit outside of work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A well built physique is a status symbol. It reflects you worked hard for it, no money can buy it. You cannot borrow it, you cannot inherit it, you cannot steal it. You cannot hold onto it without constant work. It shows discipline, it shows self respect, it shows patience, work ethic and passion. That is why I do what I do." 
- Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty outdoorsy in general and I hike and trail run on weekends.</p>
<p>I ride a Kawasaki Ninja 250. I love those little bikes, they're light and nimble and very fun to take on backroads. I'm very fond of Japanese sportbikes in general.</p>
<p>I love classic science fiction. Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> series is my favorite. I also really like cyberpunk fiction, e.g. William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em> and Neal Stephenson's <em>Snow Crash</em>. <em>The Matrix</em> film trilogy also has a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I grew up playing a lot of videogames, though I don't play anymore. <em>Half-Life 2</em> and other Valve games were extremely important in shaping my taste and formed a large part of my childhood. <em>Halo</em> also deserves a mention here. I came of age at the tail end of the era where game communities ("clans") relied mostly on PHP forums and Ventrilo/TeamSpeak/Mumble for communication. At the age of 11, I was running such a clan myself. It's a time of my life I look back on very fondly.</p>
<p>My music taste is varied, but I especially appreciate electronic music (particularly drum and bass / jungle / breakbeat), trip hop, metal, and grunge.</p>
<p>I love to rave and dance. I travel around the US and the world to attend music festivals with my friends. Some of my most important emotional experiences have happened at festivals.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roche">This dude</a> was my grandfather. I come from a family of actors and I performed on stage frequently in high school, but I chose not to enter that profession for various reasons.</p>
