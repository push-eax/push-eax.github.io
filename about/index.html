<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I grew up in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. With access to computers from a young age, I started taking things apart and putting them back together, which eventually progressed to a career in cyber.</p>
<p>I often feel that I'm in many worlds at once. I enjoy the company of people from many cultures and walks of life, and I travel the country and the world to meet and spend time with them.</p>
<h3>What I do professionally</h3>
<p>I'm a sales engineer at <a href="https://netspi.com">NetSPI</a>, an offensive security company. I work with NetSPI's sales team to scope and price penetration tests and security products. My former life as a pentester gives me unique insight and expertise that makes me a useful technical resource to our sales representatives.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/kiernan-roche">my LinkedIn</a> for a complete CV.</p>
<h3>Where I live</h3>
<p>I live and work in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<h3>Other interests</h3>
<p>I enjoy hiking, trail running, reading, film, and meditation. Though I'm not religious, I have an academic interest in theology.</p>
<p>I ride motorcycles. I'm very fond of Japanese sportbikes specifically.</p>
<p>I love classic science fiction. Frank Herbert's <em>Dune</em> series is my favorite. I also really like cyberpunk fiction, e.g. William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em> and Neal Stephenson's <em>Snow Crash</em>. <em>The Matrix</em> film trilogy also has a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I grew up playing a lot of videogames, though I don't play much anymore. <em>Half-Life 2</em> and other Valve games were extremely important in shaping my taste and formed a large part of my childhood. <em>Halo</em> also deserves a mention here. I came of age at the tail end of the era where game communities ("clans") relied mostly on PHP forums and Ventrilo/TeamSpeak/Mumble for communication. It's a time of my life I look back on very fondly.</p>
<p>My music taste is varied, but I especially appreciate electronic music (particularly drum and bass / jungle / breakbeat), trip hop, metal, and grunge.</p>
