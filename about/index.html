<em class="caption">It's me, talking about myself on the Internet.</em></p>
<p>My resume is <a href="/pdfs/Kiernan_Roche_Resume.pdf">here</a>. <!--It's only a short summary of my professional history; I go into greater detail about that, and the course of my life more generally, in <a href="#autobiography">this section</a>.--></p>
<h3>Some facts about me in descending order of professionalism</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm an information security consultant. <ul>
<li>Most of my work is penetration testing of applications and networks, which means I am hired by organizations to compromise the security of their computer systems by applying techniques used by hackers. After attacking my client's systems for a predetermined period of time, I write a report containing technical information about what access I was able to obtain, how, and what they need to do to prevent hackers from doing the same things I did. I perform this work through my company, <a href="https://mitigon.io">Mitigon</a>.</li>
<li>I've been doing this sort of work since 2018. My deep interest in and involvement with computers in general began circa 2005 and I got into infosec right before Kali replaced BackTrack.</li>
<li>My technical interests and expertise include application and network security, OS internals, malware analysis, social engineering techniques and their psychology, and the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of modern adversaries. </li>
<li>I also come from a strong programming background and deeply enjoy writing software that solves real-world problems, usually mine. Free and open source software is important to me, and I try to release whatever I create under a permissive license.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I attended Framingham State University in Framingham, Massachusetts and earned my B.S. in computer science there in May 2020.</li>
<li>I really like finance and <a href="/blog/category/finance">writing about finance</a>.<ul>
<li>In college, I worked for Fidelity Investments as a software engineer, and learned a lot about options trading and market behavior. Beating the market is effectively impossible without lots of data and low-latency order execution, so I don't actively trade for the purpose of growing my account, but I keep a small trading budget for fun.</li>
<li>I'm a hobbyist bookkeeper and keep my personal and business books in a double-entry fashion, initially in <a href="https://www.gnucash.org">GnuCash</a>. I experimented with plaintext accounting software such as <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">beancount</a>, which I used for about a year and a half before returning to GnuCash. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I like motorcycles, and am particularly fond of sportbikes.</li>
<li>Fitness, nutrition, and human physiology are deeply interesting to me. My exercise regimen includes running and weightlifting in roughly equal parts, as well as frequent hiking. I also prefer biking over driving for local transportation (where public transit is unavailable), because it's healthy, it's fun, and it's cheaper than driving.</li>
<li>My music taste is highly varied, but I especially appreciate:<ul>
<li>Electronic music in its various forms<ul>
<li>Most styles of drum &amp; bass e.g. LTJ Bukem, Technical Itch, Dom and Roland, Current Value, Katharsys, Sewerslvt</li>
<li>Breakcore and other jungle derivatives, e.g. Enduser, bioxeed, Rotator</li>
<li>Ed Harrison's game soundtrack work, especially the Neotokyo Source mod OST</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most styles of rock, metal, and derivatives thereof e.g. Deftones, Tool, Chevelle, P.O.D.</li>
<li>Noise music e.g. Merzbow, Qebrus</li>
<li>Death Grips</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have ADHD. My brain has the capacity and tendency to absorb and analyze large quantities of information quickly, but controlling <em>what</em> it focuses on requires significant effort, which can preclude sustained focus on what I <em>should</em> be doing. This made my grades highly inconsistent during my entire academic career, but over the years I developed strategies to handle this. Like many people with ADHD, I also experience hyperfocus very regularly, which is focus bordering on obsession with a task or topic sustained for a long period to the exclusion of other things. This can be tremendously helpful for completing large and complex projects quickly or rapidly learning about a new topic, but it needs to be managed to avoid neglecting other urgent tasks, such as eating and sleeping; in the depths of hyperfocus I can lose awareness of my body's physical cues.</li>
<li>My mind is analytical and calculating, and I tend to think in terms of lists, functions, cost-benefit, etc. However, I also experience emotions <strong>intensely</strong>, which is probably why I'm drawn to art, as art is the primary medium for the communication of emotional states between humans, among other functions e.g. serving as a cultural lynchpin.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Roche">This dude</a> was my grandfather. I come from a family of actors and I performed on stage frequently in high school, but I chose not to pursue that path professionally for various reasons.</li>
</ul>
